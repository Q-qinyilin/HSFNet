## Usage

### Dataset

Please download the dataset from [ISIC](https://www.isic-archive.com/) challenge and [PH2](https://www.fc.up.pt/addi/ph2%20database.html) website.

### Pre-processing

Please run:

```bash
$ python utils/resize.py
```

You need to change the **File Path** to your own and select the correct function.

### Training 

Please run:

```bash
$ python src/train.py
```
You need to change the **File Path** to your own and select the correct function.

### Testing

Download the pretrained weight for ISCI-2016&$ph^2$ dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eMHYX1fr-QvI3n50S0xqWcxc3FGsMgE/view?usp=sharing) and move to the logger dir.

Then, please run:

```bash
$ python src/test.py
```
